# Packet Monitor 1

# Introduction
==================

* its an app about monitoring "the internet you used"
- now don't get me wrong, the app will tells you how much internet you used since the day / month / session
- you will tell me why, well its for those who use internet with a limited amount and want to track their usage
-  or for who want to know their usage in general.

Packet Monitor is made to "continue" the devlopment of NetSpeedMonitor, since there where no more update since.. ages.
i also felt like adding more features, learning electron, and knowing how devlopping an app is like, 
its my "first time" using Electron JS, the app is clearly not finished its an ALPHA version.


## Requirements  
===============

* Clearly a pc, like if you don't have a pc then then.. then........ drink some tea
* Windows 64bit
* ***Internet***...


## how to
===============

* download the app from github : [Download Here](https://github.com/Madscientiste/Packet-Monitor/releases/download)
* Execute it, and you are good to go

## Important Note
===============

The black bar on the top isn't mean to be used, don't click on it or you might cause the app to crash
- im gonna remove it on future releases

The app doesn't start with windows, so the app wont monitor anything since its turned off
- be sure to turn it on if you want to monitor your data ! 
- auto start will be added on future release
